# Aizktec

Welcome to **Aizktec**! This repository is the heart of our innovative project that aims to blend cutting-edge blockchain technologies with an intuitive user interface. Our vision is to create a decentralized platform that leverages smart contracts, advanced UTXO models, and zero-knowledge proofs—all while providing a seamless web experience.

## Repository Structure

This mono-repo is organized into several packages to maintain a clean and scalable codebase. Here’s a brief overview:

- **packages/aztec/contracts**  
  *Future Home for Smart Contracts*  
  This directory will eventually contain all the smart contract code necessary for our blockchain functionalities.

- **packages/aztec/utxo**  
  *Implementing the Aztec UTXO Model*  
  Here, we will develop and integrate the Aztec model based on the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) paradigm to enhance transaction efficiency and security.

- **packages/aztec/zero-knowledge**  
  *Adding Zero-Knowledge Proofs*  
  This folder is dedicated to incorporating zero-knowledge proofs, a crucial component for ensuring privacy and trust within our ecosystem.

- **packages/nextjs**  
  *The Web Interface*  
  Our user-facing website is built here using the Bun package manager and ShadCN components. This is where the graphical part of our platform comes to life.

## Getting Started

As the project evolves, each folder will include its own detailed README with specific instructions and documentation. For now, this main README serves as a high-level guide to the project structure and our goals.

## Contributing

We love contributions! Whether you're interested in smart contracts, blockchain development, or web design, there's a place for you in Aizktec. Keep an eye out for our contribution guidelines, and check out our project on OnlyDust to apply for issues.
